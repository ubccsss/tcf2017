# Need Help?

If you need any assistance during the event, you have several options

### Find a Volunteer

Volunteers will be walking around the venue, and they're all sporting an awesome TCF badge so they're easy to spot.

### Visit the Info Booth

This booth is located at the front of the venue, and you probably passed it on the way in. Helpful volunteers will always be stationed here.
