We run our business in much the same way. Our employees come as they are and do what they love. Imagine the opportunities you’ll have in a company with 100,000 employees in more than 100 countries, working on hundreds of products—spanning games, phones, developer tools, business solutions and operating systems. We work hard, but we value work/life balance, and each of us defines what that means to us. So why not explore what we do, where we do it, and what life is really like at Microsoft. You just might be surprised.   

No matter what your passion is, you’ll find it here. You can work on a multi-billion dollar global business or a revolutionary technology that hasn’t yet left the lab. Join us at Microsoft and start your journey.
