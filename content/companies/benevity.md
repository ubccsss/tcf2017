Better Work and a Better World: at Benevity that’s what we’re all about. We’re a software company in the business of doing good, building better ways for companies to connect with their customers and employees around causes (we make “doing well by doing good” more than just a tagline!). We’re growing fast and looking for more great people to join us. 

We’re not Bono, just a passionate crew of workhorses out to change the world. We have that fun, flexible tech culture that people love (ok, some people – you know who you are!) – and we have a heart. We’re a registered B Corporation, which means we’re part of a new breed of companies committed to higher social and environmental standards.
